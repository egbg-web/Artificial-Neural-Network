# Artificial-Neural-Network
Neural networks are distributed computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain, consisting of many simple processing elements which are connected in a network. Neural networks are increasingly used in the engineering sciences for tasks such as pattern recognition, prediction and control. The theory of neural networks is a inter-disciplinary field (neurobiology, computer science and statistical physics). The course gives an overview and a basic understanding of neural-network algorithms and can develop an understanding of when neural networks are useful in application problems
